# chess_v2

A repository to store the code for the second version of my interactive chess game. This is written in vanilla Javascript usign the p5 Javascript library. The previous version of this can be found [here](https://github.com/munjoonteo/chess).

Try it out [here](https://munjoonteo.github.io/chess_v2/)!

Improvements over the previous version:

- Better OOP principles
- Generally less spaghetti code
