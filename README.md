# chess_v2

The second version of my interactive chess game. It is written in vanilla Javascript usign the p5 Javascript library. The previous version of this can be found [here](https://github.com/munjoonteo/chess).

Try it out [here](https://munjoonteo.github.io/chess_v2/)!

Improvements over the previous version:

- Better OOP principles (more effective encapsulation and delegation of responsibilities)
- Generally less spaghetti code
